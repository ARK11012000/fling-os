# FlingOS™ - Getting Started Tutorials

Resources to accompany the FlingOS™ Getting Started tutorial series. Links to the tutorials can be found on the main [FlingOS website](http://www.flingos.co.uk).

## How to use these resources

It is intended that you watch the videos alongside looking at these resources. The videos do not include images of every part of the code. It is intended that you can watch the videos and then be able to read and understand the code. Neither the videos or the resources are intended to be taken in isolation. 

The tutorials follow on from each other and each tutorial contains a Code folder with multiple samples in it. Each sample progresses from the next in small steps so you can see how the system builds up. Where possible, every sample is created in assembly, C and C#.
